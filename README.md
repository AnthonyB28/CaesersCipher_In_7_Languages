CaesersCipher_In_7_Languages
============================
Goals

• to  enjoy	a	simple	programming	assignment	done	in	a	wide	variety	programming	languages,	
both	historical	and	recent,	both	procedural	and	functional.
• to	re>lect	on	this	experience	though	a	consulting	log.
• to	discuss	some	philosophical	thoughts	and	pondering	about	programming	and	languages.


Instrucions 

1.Develop	a	set	of	functions	that	will	allow	you	to	encrypt	a	string	using	a	Caesar	cipher.
2.Develop	a	set	of	functions	that	will	allow	you	to	decrypt	a	string	using	a	Caesar	cipher.
3.Develop	a	set	of	functions	that	will	help	you	to	solve	(break)	the	cipher.


Implement	all	of	the	above	functions	in	all	of	the	following	languages:
Encrypt,	Decrypt,	Solve	in	Fortran	 [15,	15,	20	points]
Encrypt,	Decrypt,	Solve	in	Cobol	 [15,	15,	20	points]
